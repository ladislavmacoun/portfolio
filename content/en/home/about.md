Hi, my name is Ladislav, I have more than 5 years of experience in software 
development. I started as a researcher at [CESNET](https://www.cesnet.cz/?lang=en)
during my college years at CTU. I worked at [Rockwell Automation](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/)
in the R&D in security toolkit team. Where I worked on secure protocols and tools
for embedded systems. Currently, I challenge the speed of light in the [CDN77](https://www.cdn77.com/)
where I work on speeding the internet as a software engineer developing software
components and tools for handling more than 8 Gbps traffic.

I love to code, especially using GoLang or C.
